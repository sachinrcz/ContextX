# ContextX

ContextX is a powerful open-source chrome extension to enhance social media experience by providing context analysis of the content you are reading.

# Our manifesto

- ### Transparency above all
    We are built on trust. Every insight we provide is backed by clear sources, so users can see where their information comes from and assess its credibility themselves.

- ### Neutrality at our core
    Context doesn’t label content as “true” or “false” or “left” or “right.” We provide balanced perspectives to empower critical thinking and informed decisions without bias.

- ### User-centric design
    Your experience matters. We prioritize simplicity, accessibility, and seamless integration into your daily life, ensuring clarity is always within reach.

- ### Empowered knowledge
    Our mission is to amplify your ability to understand the world. We blend advanced AI with human expertise to deliver precise, relevant, and actionable insights.

- ### Open by nature
    We embrace open-source principles to foster transparency, collaboration, and innovation. By involving the community, we ensure Context evolves to meet the highest standards of trust and quality.
